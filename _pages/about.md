## **About Me**

I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Tokyo.
I'm interested in artificial intelligence in general, and particularly in LLMs and autonomous agents.
Most of my prior research work has been about machine learning theories (feel free to have a look at my papers published in top-tier AI conference and journal such as NeurIPS and TMLR, if you are interested).
Outside of campus, I spent a year at Google Tokyo as a visiting LLM researcher, where I had the chance to work with the top minds in the LLM community from all over the world.
